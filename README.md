RNA all-atom-MD Analysis Scripts.

Personal codes developed for the analysis of MD trajectories of RNA objects, and more specifically the hairpin ribozyme. 
These scripts are either notebooks, bash or python scripts developed along my thesis.

Specifically, this folder contains the codes used to perform the analysis of the trajectory of the hairpin ribozyme, and to generate the types of graphical representations proposed in Forget, S., et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20 (14), 6263â€“6277. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00294.


## How to run

Open as jupyter notebook, and upload your datas. 

In the case of bash scripts, 

## Requirements
A few python libraries are required: 
- MDAnalysis
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

And other basic python3 libraries.
